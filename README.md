# CS230 Project - Pokémon Image & Text Generator

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to generate new Pokémon characters with both sprite images and description text to accompany it. We make use of the StyleGAN2-ADA library and CLIP library to complete the two halves of this project, first to generate images of characters, and then to pair it with generated text descriptions.
